## Project Overview
Welcome to **InsightScape**, a comprehensive project designed to monitor and maintain Azure resources. This project focuses on creating an integrated monitoring and maintenance framework using Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, KQL, Application Insights, Network Watcher, Security Center, and Azure Backup to ensure comprehensive visibility, security, and performance optimization across cloud environments.

- **Programming required?**: ‚ùå (This project relies mostly on configuration and integration, though an understanding of Kusto Query Language (KQL) is essential for custom monitoring queries.)

## Azure Services Used
- **Azure Monitor**: Monitoring solution to track metrics and logs.
- **Azure Log Analytics**: Analyzing telemetry data to gain insights.
- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**: Used for writing custom monitoring queries.
- **Azure Application Insights**: For performance monitoring of the WebApp.
- **Azure Network Watcher**: Network monitoring and diagnostics.
- **Azure Security Center**: Evaluates and provides security recommendations.
- **Azure Backup**: Backup and recovery services for Azure VMs.
- **Azure Alerts**: Configured alerts for resource health and other monitoring activities.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to validate my hands-on skills in the **Monitor and Maintain Azure Resources** aspect of the **AZ-104 Certification**. The approach was to set up major and commonly used Azure resources and then work with Azure monitoring and security services.

## Steps I Did:

### Step 1: Resources Setup

#### a) Resource Group and VNet Setup
- Created a **Resource Group** named **InsightScape-RG** in the **East US** region.
- Created a **Virtual Network (VNet)** named **InsightScape-VNet** with the following subnets:
  - **VM1-Subnet**: `10.1.1.0/24`
  - **VM2-Subnet**: `10.1.2.0/24`

#### b) Virtual Machines (VMs) and Network Security Groups (NSGs)
- Created a Windows VM named **InsightScape-VM1** and a Linux VM named **InsightScape-VM2** in the **InsightScape-RG**.
  - **InsightScape-VM1** (Windows Server 2019 Datacenter) configured with an NSG allowing inbound **RDP, HTTP, and HTTPS** traffic.
  - **InsightScape-VM2** (Ubuntu 22.04) configured with an NSG allowing inbound **SSH, HTTPS, and HTTP** traffic.
- Updated NSGs:
  - Added an inbound security rule to **InsightScape-VM1-NSG** for allowing **HTTPS** traffic.
  - No changes made to **InsightScape-VM2-NSG** as default configurations were sufficient.

### Step 2: Azure Monitor Integration

#### 1) Monitoring Setup for Deployed Resources
- Enabled **Azure Monitor Insights** for both VMs, the WebApp, and the Logic App.
- Set up **Alerts** for **High CPU Usage** on **InsightScape-VM1**.

#### 2) Activity Logs, Metrics, and Diagnostic Settings
- Configured **Metrics** for VMs, WebApp, and Logic App.
- Installed **Diagnostics Extensions** on VMs.
- Enabled **Diagnostic Settings** for **WebApp** and **Default Log Analytics Workspace**.

#### 3) Monitor Resource Health

- **Virtual Machines**: Accessed **Resource Health** under **Service Health** in Azure Monitor for **InsightScape-VM1** and **InsightScape-VM2** to verify health status.
- **WebApp**: Selected **Website** as the resource type in **Resource Health**. Resolved a **Critical Risk alert** related to Health Check failure by configuring and enabling health check.
- **Logic App**: Verified health using two methods:
  - Checked **Run History** in Development Tools to verify successful runs.
  - Monitored **Actions Failed** metric under **Monitoring** to ensure no failed actions.
