# Screenshots - Step 8 Backup and Disaster Recovery

This directory contains screenshots documenting the **Backup and Disaster Recovery** phase of the **InsightScape** project. These screenshots include verifying the backup of **InsightScape-VM1** in the **Recovery Services Vault**, deleting the virtual machine for disaster recovery validation, and restoring the virtual machine using the latest restore point. The recovery process involved creating a new VM named **InsightScape-VM1-AfterRestore** with matching configurations to ensure a successful disaster recovery test.
